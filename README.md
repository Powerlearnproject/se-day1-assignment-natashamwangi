# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of applying design principles, methods and tools to develop high quality software systems.

Importance:
- Help in solving real world problems
- Help build applications, website and games that will make our lives easier and that users will love

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Development of software programming languages such as Fotran
- Development of software engineering as a discpline in the 1960s
- Origin of structured programming that enables reuse of code which enhances readability and facilitates easier maintenance of code
- The rise of agile methodologies

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software Development Cycle is the process of developing a software that is carried out in several phases:
- User Requirement Gathering: Understanding the user needs and requirements
- Design: Creating detailed user interface and software architecture based on the user requirements gathered
- Implementation: Writing code based and building software based on the designs created above
- Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure that the software created meets the quality standards and the software functional requirements
- Deployment: Launch of the developed software making readily available to the intended users
- Maintenance: Providing ongoing updates, support and enhancements of the software after it has been deployed.


4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology uses a waterfallor sequential approach, where it follows the Software Development Cycle Process from the first phase all the way to the last phase, while Agile Methodology uses an iterative approach, focusing on continous feedback given for flexibility and improvements

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer:
Write code to develop software solutions
Fix the bugs that may appear in the software development process

Quality Assurance Engineer
Ensure the software and code written by the Software Developer meets quality standards and functional requirements of the end user

Project Manager
Oversees the software development process, from user requirement gathering to software deployment
Coordinate team to ensure timely and successful project delivery

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): These are software tools that are used to write, debug and test code e.g Visual Studio Code
   Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools that are used to track changes in source code, especially when collaborating with other team members to develop a software e.g Git


7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a. Identifying and fixing bugs that may be time consuming
Strategy - Using debugging tools such as breakpoints
b. Meeting tight deadlines to deliver software products
Strategy - Breaking down the project onto manageable tasks using Agile methodologies that will help set realistic goals and can be able to track progress
c. Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays
Strategy - Have a minimum viable product that is workable and break the project into small sprints that are manageable
d. Technical Debt: This accrued from time whereby software developers come up with rushed implementations that lead to unmaintainable code and increase maintenance costs.
Strategy - Follow best coding practices and write clean, maintainable code

8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing - Testing of a single module or component of a software application
- Integration Testing - Testing of 2 or more components that interact with each other to verify that they work correctly
- System Testing - Testing of the entire software as a whole
- Acceptance Testing - Testing of the software against the user requirements to ensure that it meets the user needs


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of defining and refining text prompts  to generate high quality natural responses from a language model
Importance - To generate high quality responses for more relevant outputs that later translates to developing solutions that makes our lives easier
 
2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt - Draft a concept note on various aspects that affect climate 
Improved prompt - Draft a concept note that outlines key factors that contribute to climate change and proposed solutions
